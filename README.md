# Article-Summarizer-Application


Developed an Article Summarizer Application using OpenAI's GPT model.

Alongside building this application, I also learn how to:

- create a responsive, beautiful UI/UX with a nice touch of glass morphism using Tailwind CSS
- make advanced RTK query API requests that fire on condition
- save history using the local storage
- handle form events and catch errors
- implement copy to clipboard
- write clean code
